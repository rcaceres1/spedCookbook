## Next Steps
I would like to add more activities to the database, create an option to comment on an activity, and extend authorization to delete from only the admiinstrator's side, rather than the user. Eventually, I would want this website to serve as a living app where Special Educaton Teachers can collaborate, and use ideas to better serve their students.
